That the Applicant is operator and owns or has the support of the majority working interest within Section 16,\\nTownship 8 North, Range 15 West; Section 21, Township 8 North, Range 15 West; Section 15, Township 8 North, Range 15 West; and Section 22, Township 8 North, Range 15 West, Conway County, Arkansas.\\n2.   The Applicant proposes to drill a cross-unit horizontal well targeting the Fayetteville Shale Formation and any\\nintervening formations. The surface location is planned in the Southwest Quarter of Section 22, Township 8 North, Range 15 West with a bottom hole location in the Southeast Quarter of Section 16, Township 8 North, Range 15 West.\\n3.   Utilizing an area encompassed an exterior which is defined by a distance of 560 feet measured perpendicular\\nto both sides of the proposed well bore and a radius extending 560 feet from the first perforation (heel) and the last perforation (toe), the applicant estimates that the allocation area encompassing the perforated well bore is approximately 10.99% of Section 16, Township 8 North, Range 15 West and 42.23% of Section 21, Township\\n8 North, Range 15 West and 8.19% of Section 15, Township 8 North, Range 15 West and 38.59% of Section\\n22, Township 8 North, Range 15 West.\\n4.   The  Applicant  proposes  that  operations  will  be  conducted  under  the  terms  of  Model  Form  Operating\\nAgreements adopted by the Commission, with the non-consent penalty being 400% for the proposed well; and that the above allocation of cost shall be effective for the drilling of the proposed well through the setting of production casing. The following terms will also govern the drilling and completion of the proposed well:\\n(A)         After the setting of production casing, but before a completion attempt is made, drilling cost will be\\nreallocated, based upon the actual perforated interval available for completion in the as-drilled well bore. This re-allocation may result in a revision to working interest and all costs paid to that point will be adjusted.\\n(B)         If a well bore is lost during the drilling or completion operation and a replacement well bore is\\nproposed with an alternate azimuth that will result in a further reallocation of working interest participation or the allocation of the production, the replacement well will be treated as a new well proposal with the revised interest. All parties that participate in the drilling and completion attempt in the initial well will be liable for their proportionate share of the actual cost of operation to the point of setting a plug for side-track operations, based on their original interest.\\n(C)         Should any party that elected to participate in the initial well elect to not participate in the replacement\\nwell, the penalty for a non-consent election in the replacement well will be imposed on only the replacement well costs. A non-participating party in the initial well will not be afforded the opportunity to participate in the replacement well and their penalty will be imposed on the cumulative cost of the initial well and the replacement well.\\n(D)         Any re-allocation after the setting of production casing will be final for the completion attempt and for\\nthe ultimate allocation of production from the well between the respective units.\\n5.   That the granting of this application will be protective of the correlative rights of all interested parties and will\\nprevent waste of the natural gas by permitting an efficient method of developing the resource within multiple drilling units\\n6.   That no objections were filed.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\xa0OF\\xa0LAW\\n1.   That due notice of public hearing was given as required by law and that this Commission has jurisdiction over\\nsaid parties and the matter herein considered.\\n2.   That this Commission has authority to grant said application under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as\\namended.\\nORDER\\nIt is, therefore, Ordered by the Commission:\\n1.   The Applicant’s application for authority to produce its Poole-Kirtley 8-15 #15-22H16 well is hereby approved.\\n2.   The Applicant shall share the costs of such well and the natural gas produced therefrom in the manner\\ndescribed in Finding Nos. 3 and 4 above.\\n3.   That if the subject well encroaches upon but does not cross the drilling unit boundary of an adjoining drilling\\nunit (an “encroaching well”), the Commission shall not consider the encroached-upon drilling unit to be held by production from the encroaching well.\\n4.   That the following requirements are placed upon the drilling units from which production is allocated by\\napplicant’s well:\\na.       There is at least one well located, as defined in subsection (a)(2) of General Rule B-3, at a non-\\nexceptional well location and located entirely within each included drilling unit that is producing or capable of producing gas; or\\nb.       Within twelve (12) months following the date the well for which approval is granted is spud, there will\\nbe at least one well located, as defined in subsection (a)(2) of General Rule B-3, at a non- exceptional well location and located entirely within each included drilling unit that is either a well that is producing gas, or a well that is capable of producing gas and awaiting connection to a pipeline; or\\nc.       There is at least one well or a combination of multiple wells, including cross unit wells and/or\\nencroaching wells located, as defined in subsection (a)(2) of General Rule B-3, within each included drilling unit that have a total combined perforated lateral length within the drilling unit of not less than 4160 feet, and are producing or are capable of producing gas; or\\nd.       Within twelve (12) months following the date the well for which approval is granted is spud, there will\\nbe at least one well or a combination of multiple wells, including cross unit wells and or encroaching wells located, as defined in subsection (a)(2) of General Rule B-3, within each included drilling unit that have a total combined perforated lateral length within the drilling unit of not less than 4160 feet, and are producing or are capable of producing gas and awaiting connection to a pipeline.\\nThis Order shall be effective from and after July 09, 2014; and the Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction for\\nthe purposes of enforcement, and/or modifications or amendments to the provisions of this Order. This Order will automatically terminate under any of the following conditions: well drilling operations have not been commenced within one year after the effective date; or one year following cessation of drilling operations if no production is established; or, within one year from the cessation of production from the units.\\nARKANSAS OIL AND GAS COMMISSION\\nLawrence E.

Elect\\xa0“Non-Consent”\\nNot participate and become a “Non-Consenting Party” under the JOA with respect to the initial well, and\\nbe subject to all of the non-consent provisions thereunder, until the proceeds realized from the sale of hydrocarbons allocable to the mineral interest subject to said parties’ leasehold interest(s) in the initial well, exclusive of reasonable leasehold royalty, shall equal the total recoupment amount described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article VI.B.2 of the JOA, with the non-consent penalty under Article VI.B.2(b) being 400% for the initial well, and/or 400% for each subsequent well drilled on the Unit; or\\n3.   Failure\\xa0to\\xa0Make\\xa0an\\xa0Election\\nUncommitted leasehold working interest(s) owners who fail to timely elect either alternative shall be\\ndeemed to have elected Alternative (B2), above.\\n9.

ALLOCATION\\xa0OF\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nThe hydrocarbons that are produced and saved from the well or wells assigned to the above described Unit shall\\nbe allocated to each separately owned tract embraced therein in the proportion that the acreage of such tract bears to the total acreage in the Unit and shall be considered as if produced from each such tract.\\n3.   OPERATOR\\xa0TO\\xa0CHARGE\\xa0COSTS\\nThe designated operator of the Unit shall have the right to charge to each participating party its proportionate share\\nof the actual expenditures required for the costs of developing and operating the well in the manner set forth in Exhibit “C” of the JOA.\\n4.   ELECTION\\xa0OF\\xa0ALTERNATIVES\\nThe owners of the unleased mineral and/or uncommitted leasehold working interests designated in Finding Nos. 5\\nand/or 6 above (unless dismissed at the request of the Applicant in the Statement of the Case above), in the aforementioned Unit shall have fifteen (15) days from the effective date of this order (the “Election Period”) to elect one of the alternatives as described in Finding No. 8 above. If no such election is made within the applicable Election Period, the owners of unleased mineral interest(s) shall be deemed to have elected under Alternative A4 and uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) owners shall be deemed to have elected under Alternative B3, as described in Finding No. 8. Any party choosing to participate or go non-consent or, who by the terms of this Order are deemed non-consent, shall be subject to the election period set forth in the JOA with respect to all subsequent wells drilled on the Unit.\\n5.

Unleased\\xa0Mineral\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nIn the event the owners of the unleased mineral interest(s) elect Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) described\\nin Finding No. 8 above, then the value of the production proceeds attributable to such unleased mineral interest shall be subdivided and paid in accordance with the provisions of Order No. 6 as hereinafter set forth. The value of hydrocarbons produced shall be equal to the proceeds realized from the sale thereof at the well. Upon recoupment by the “Consenting Parties” (as defined in the JOA) of the total recoupment amount described in Finding No. 8A3 above, the production due the interest(s) of said parties shall be paid to them, their heirs, successors or assigns.\\nB.       Uncommitted\\xa0Leasehold\\xa0Working\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nIn the event an uncommitted leasehold working interest owner under one or more valid lease(s) elects\\nAlternative No. B2 (Non-Consent) described in Finding No. 8 above, the Consenting Parties shall have the right to receive the hydrocarbon production which would otherwise be delivered or paid to such uncommitted leasehold working interest owner under such lease(s) until such time as the proceeds realized from the sale of such production equals the total recoupment amount described in Finding No. 8B2 above.\\nThe leasehold royalty payable during the recoupment period shall be calculated on the basis of the rate or\\nrates provided in each of the leases creating the rights temporarily transferred pending recoupment.\\n6.   SUBDIVISION\\xa0OF\\xa0TRACT\\xa0ALLOCATION\\nThe revenue realized by the Consenting Parties from the sale of hydrocarbons shall be allocated among the\\nseparately owned tracts within the integrated unit and, pending recoupment of the costs and additional sum described at Paragraph No. 5 of this Order, shall be paid to the integrated parties as follows:\\nA.       Unleased\\xa0Mineral\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nUnleased mineral interest owners who have elected under Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) described in\\nFinding No. 8 above shall have the total allocation given to the tract subdivided into the working interest and royalty interest portions on the basis of seven-eighths (7/8th) of the total allocation being assigned to the working interest portion and one-eighth (1/8th) of the total allocation being assigned to the royalty interest portion.\\nB.       Uncommitted\\xa0Leasehold\\xa0Working\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nLeasehold royalty shall be paid according to the provisions of the valid lease(s) existing for each separately\\nowned tract, except where the Commission finds that such lease(s) provide for an excessive, unreasonably high, rate of royalty, as compared with the royalty determined by the Commission to be reasonable and consistent with the royalty negotiated for lease(s) made at arm\\'s length in the general area where the Unit is located, in which case the royalty stipulated in the second paragraph of Paragraph 5B of this Order shall be payable with respect to such lease(s).\\n7.   RECORDS\\xa0OF\\xa0UNIT\\xa0OPERATION\\nThe designated Operator shall, upon request and at least monthly, furnish to the other parties any and all\\ninformation pertaining to wells drilled, production secured and hydrocarbons marketed from the Unit. The books, records and vouchers relating to the operation of the Unit shall be kept open to the non-operators for inspection at reasonable times.\\n8.   PAYMENT\\xa0FOR\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nDuring the period of recoupment, the revenue allocable to those owners of the integrated unleased mineral\\ninterest(s) who elect Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) and to the mineral interest(s) subject to and covered by the integrated uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) whose owners elect or shall be deemed to have elected Alternative No. B2 (Non-Consent), both described in Finding No. 8 above (collectively, the “non-consent interests”), shall be paid to those Consenting Parties that elect to acquire their proportionate share of such non-consent interests pursuant to Paragraph 9 of this Order.\\n9.   SHARING\\xa0OF\\xa0NON-CONSENT\\xa0INTERESTS\\nThe designated Operator shall offer each Consenting Party in the initial well who executes the JOA, or who elects\\nto participate under this Order, prior to the expiration of the Election Period an opportunity to acquire its proportionate share of all non-consent interests in the initial well pursuant to the terms of Article VI.B.2. of the JOA. The designated Operator shall likewise offer each Consenting Party in the initial well the opportunity to acquire its proportionate share of any leasehold interest acquired by the Applicant as the result of any unleased mineral owner’s deemed election under Alternative A4 of Finding No. 8 (collectively, the “A4 Interests”); provided, however, this Paragraph 9 shall not apply to:\\n(i) any A4 Interest that is not marketable; or\\n(ii) any A4 Interest that is less than a perpetual interest in the mineral estate (i.e. a term interest, life estate or\\nremainder interest) and which must be integrated in order to make perpetual an existing leasehold interest in the Unit.\\nAny A4 Interest described in subpart (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be retained by the Applicant if\\nthe Applicant is the owner of the existing leasehold interest which is made perpetual by such A4 Interest. If the Applicant is not the owner of such existing leasehold interest, the Applicant shall tender such A4 Interest to the owner(s) of the existing leasehold interest that is made perpetual by such A4 Interest.\\nAny Consenting Party electing to acquire a share of any A4 Interests, pursuant to this paragraph, shall notify the\\nApplicant within five business days after receiving an offer from the Applicant indicating the amount of interest available and the cost of that interest, and immediately reimburse the Applicant for such Consenting Party’s proportionate share of the lease bonus payable with respect to such A4 Interests.\\n10.

The well was originally projected to include only Sections 28, 29, 30 and 32 as participant units within the well’s sharing formula. The well’s as-drilled path deviated slightly south and west of its projected course, its allocation area now also includes a small portion of Section 31.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Applicant proposes to make a revised allocation of cost for the well between Sections 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 based upon an area in acres (“allocation area”) defined by an exterior boundary 560 feet perpendicular to both sides of the estimated perforated well bore and a radius extending 560 feet from the estimated first perforation (toe) and last perforation (heel) of the well bore. The Applicant calculates that the total allocation area encompassing the perforated well bore is approximately 137.82627845 acres. Approximately 120.77049069 acres or 87.62515541% of the total area is within Section 29, approximately 4.13995677 acres or 3.00374995% of the total area is within Section 30, approximately 12.48132253 acres or 9.05583657% of the total area is within Section 32, approximately 0.43409352 acres or 0.31495701% of the total area is within Section 28 and approximately 0.00041494 acres or 0.00030106% of the total area is within Section 31.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Applicant proposes that the above allocation be applicable to all costs of the well, incurred to date, as well as all future production and production revenues from the well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe applicant requests that this application be granted, without notice, with an order which will then expire, if it is not made permanent by a subsequent order approved by the Commission at its August, 2013 hearing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThat in view of the evidence presented an emergency exists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThat no objections were filed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\\n\\n\\n\\nThat this Commission has authority to grant said application under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as amended, more specifically Ark Code Ann. § 15-71-111.\\n\\n\\n\\nORDER\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is, therefore, ordered by the Commission, that the Applicant’s request for an emergency order of the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission granting the authority to produce the Hall Charles 9-13 4-30H29H well and share the costs of such well and the natural gas therefrom between the working interest owners and royalty owners as described in Finding No. 3 above is hereby granted.\\n\\n\\n\\nORDER NO. 191-2013-07 (Emergency Order) July 23, 2013\\n\\nPAGE 2 of 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis order shall be effective from and after July 23, 2013; and the Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcement, and/or modifications of amendments to the provisions of this Order.

The alternatives for integrated parties are:\\nA.      Unleased\\xa0Mineral\\xa0Interest(s)\\xa0Alternatives:\\n1.   Lease\\nExecute a lease covering the unleased mineral interest(s) with any party upon mutually agreed terms,\\nprovided that Applicant receives notice prior to the close of the “Election Period” provided in Paragraph No. 4 of the Order below (lessee would then be bound by the terms of this order as an uncommitted working interest owner, regardless of whether such owner is listed in Finding No. 6 above); or execute and deliver to the Applicant a Lease as identified in Finding No. 4 covering their unleased mineral interest(s) in the aforementioned Unit, for a cash bonus of $2500.00 per net mineral acre as fair and reasonable compensation in lieu of the election to participate with a working interest in said Unit and that said Lease(s) provide for a 1/5 royalty, and that each such owner thereafter be bound by the terms of said Lease, including for purposes of subsequent operations, (whether or not such owner actually executes such Lease)\\nfor so long as there is production of hydrocarbons from within the Unit. Applicant must tender said lease\\nbonus, subject to any applicable federal or state income tax “backup withholding” provisions, within thirty (30) days of the date an election is made; if such payment cannot be made due to issues regarding marketability of title, unknown addresses, or unknown successors in interests, then the Applicant shall pay said bonus into one or more identifiable trust accounts (which shall be accounts in a bank, savings bank, trust company, savings and loan association, credit union, or federally regulated investment company, and the institution shall be insured by an agency of the federal government); or if payment cannot be made for any other reason, then the Applicant may appear before the Commission to request an extension of time and the Commission may condition the granting of such extension upon payment of a reasonable sum which shall be paid as an additional bonus to the unleased mineral owner.\\n2.   Participate\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0initial\\xa0well\\nParticipate by paying their proportionate share in the costs of drilling, completing, equipping and operating\\nthe initial well, subject to the terms of the JOA, and that each such owner thereafter be bound by the terms of such JOA (whether or not such owner actually executes such agreement), including for purposes of subsequent operations, for so long as there is production of hydrocarbons from within the Unit; or\\n3.

Each such owner shall be bound by the terms of the JOA both before and after recovery of such recoupment amount and also for purposes of proposals for and the conduct of\\nany and all subsequent operations within the Unit, for so long as there is hydrocarbon production from within the Unit. One-eighth (1/8th) of the revenue realized from the sale of such owner’s share of production from the initial well, and any subsequent well proposed under the terms of the JOA in which such owner elects not\\nto participate, shall be paid to such mineral interest owner from the date of first production at the times and in the manner prescribed by law for the payment of royalty; or\\n4.   Failure\\xa0to\\xa0Make\\xa0an\\xa0Election.\\nUnleased mineral owners who fail to affirmatively elect one of the options listed in 8A above, shall be\\ndeemed integrated into the Unit and shall be compensated for the removal of hydrocarbons by the payment of a cash bonus of $2500.00 per net mineral acre, and a 1/5 royalty.\\nApplicant must tender said lease bonus, subject to any applicable federal or state income tax “backup\\nwithholding” provisions, within thirty (30) days of the expiration period of the “Election Period,” described in No. 4 of the Order below; if such payment cannot be made due to issues regarding marketability of title, unknown addresses, or unknown successors in interests, then the Applicant shall pay said bonus into one or more identifiable trust accounts (which shall be accounts in a bank, savings bank, trust company, savings and loan association, credit union, or federally regulated investment company, and the institution shall be insured by an agency of the federal government); or if payment cannot be made for any other reason, then the Applicant may appear before the Commission to request an extension of time and the Commission may condition the granting of such extension upon payment of a reasonable sum which shall be paid as an additional bonus to the unleased mineral owner.\\nB.

Participate\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0well\\nParticipate by paying their proportionate share in the costs of drilling, completing, equipping and operating\\nthe initial well, subject to the terms of the JOA, and that each such owner thereafter be bound by the terms of such JOA (whether or not such owner actually executes such agreement), including for purposes of subsequent operations, for so long as there is production of hydrocarbons from within the Unit; or\\n2.   Elect\\xa0“Non-Consent”\\nNot participate and become a “Non-Consenting Party” under the JOA with respect to the initial well, and be\\nsubject to all of the non-consent provisions thereunder, until the proceeds realized from the sale of hydrocarbons allocable to the mineral interest subject to said parties’ leasehold interest(s) in the initial well, exclusive of reasonable leasehold royalty, shall equal the total recoupment amount described in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article VI.B.2 of the JOA, with the non-consent penalty under Article VI.B.2(b) being 400% for the initial well, and/or 400% for each subsequent well drilled on the Unit; or\\n3.

That due notice of public hearing was given as required by law and that this Commission has jurisdiction over said\\nparties and the matter herein considered.\\n2.   That the land described in Finding No. 1 has been previously established as a drilling unit.\\n3.   That this Commission has authority to grant said application and force pool and integrate the unleased mineral\\ninterest(s) and uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) of said parties under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as amended.\\nORDER\\nNow, therefore, it is Ordered that:\\n1.   INTEGRATION\\nAll of the unleased mineral interest(s) and/or uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) described in Finding Nos. 5\\nand/or 6 (unless dismissed at the request of the Applicant in the Statement of the Case above) within the Unit described in Finding No. 1 be and are hereby integrated into one unit for drilling and production purposes.\\n2.   ALLOCATION\\xa0OF\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nThe hydrocarbons that are produced and saved from the well or wells assigned to the above described Unit shall be\\nallocated to each separately owned tract embraced therein in the proportion that the acreage of such tract bears to the total acreage in the Unit and shall be considered as if produced from each such tract.\\n3.   OPERATOR\\xa0TO\\xa0CHARGE\\xa0COSTS\\nThe designated operator of the Unit shall have the right to charge to each participating party its proportionate share of\\nthe actual expenditures required for the costs of developing and operating the well in the manner set forth in Exhibit “C” of the JOA.\\n4.   ELECTION\\xa0OF\\xa0ALTERNATIVES\\nThe owners of the unleased mineral and/or uncommitted leasehold working interests designated in Finding Nos. 5\\nand/or 6 above (unless dismissed at the request of the Applicant in the Statement of the Case above), in the aforementioned Unit shall have fifteen (15) days from the effective date of this order (the “Election Period”) to elect one of the alternatives as described in Finding No. 8 above. If no such election is made within the Election Period, the owners of unleased mineral interest(s) shall be deemed to have elected under Alternative A4 and uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) owners shall be deemed to have elected under Alternative B3, as described in Finding No.\\n8. Any party choosing to participate or go non-consent or, who by the terms of this Order are deemed non-consent, shall be subject to the election period set forth in the JOA with respect to all subsequent wells drilled on the Unit.\\n5.   RECEIPT\\xa0OF\\xa0VALUE\\xa0OF\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nA.      Unleased\\xa0Mineral\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nIn the event the owners of the unleased mineral interest(s) elect Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) described in\\nFinding No. 8 above, then the value of the production proceeds attributable to such unleased mineral interest shall be subdivided and paid in accordance with the provisions of Order No. 6 as hereinafter set forth. The value of hydrocarbons produced shall be equal to the proceeds realized from the sale thereof at the well. Upon recoupment by the “Consenting Parties” (as defined in the JOA) of the total recoupment amount described in Finding No. 8A3 above, the production due the interest(s) of said parties shall be paid to them, their heirs, successors or assigns.\\nB.      Uncommitted\\xa0Leasehold\\xa0W\\xa0orking\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nIn the event an uncommitted leasehold working interest owner under one or more valid lease(s) elects Alternative\\nNo. B2 (Non-Consent) described in Finding No. 8 above, the Consenting Parties shall have the right to receive the hydrocarbon production which would otherwise be delivered or paid to such uncommitted leasehold working interest owner under such lease(s) until such time as the proceeds realized from the sale of such production equals the total recoupment amount described in Finding No. 8B2 above.\\nThe leasehold royalty payable during the recoupment period shall be calculated on the basis of the rate or rates\\nprovided in each of the leases creating the rights temporarily transferred pending recoupment.\\n6.   SUBDIVISION\\xa0OF\\xa0TRACT\\xa0ALLOCATION\\nThe revenue realized by the Consenting Parties from the sale of hydrocarbons shall be allocated among the separately\\nowned tracts within the integrated unit and, pending recoupment of the costs and additional sum described at Paragraph No. 5 of this Order, shall be paid to the integrated parties as follows:\\nA.      Unleased\\xa0Mineral\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nUnleased mineral interest owners who have elected under Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) described in Finding\\nNo. 8 above shall have the total allocation given to the tract subdivided into the working interest and royalty interest portions on the basis of seven-eighths (7/8th) of the total allocation being assigned to the working interest portion and one-eighth (1/8th) of the total allocation being assigned to the royalty interest portion.\\nB.      Uncommitted\\xa0Leasehold\\xa0W\\xa0orking\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nLeasehold royalty shall be paid according to the provisions of the valid lease(s) existing for each separately\\nowned tract, except where the Commission finds that such lease(s) provide for an excessive, unreasonably high, rate of royalty, as compared with the royalty determined by the Commission to be reasonable and consistent with the royalty negotiated for lease(s) made at arm\\'s length in the general area where the Unit is located, in which case the royalty stipulated in the second paragraph of Paragraph 5B of this Order shall be payable with respect to such lease(s).\\n7.   RECORDS\\xa0OF\\xa0UNIT\\xa0OPERATION\\nThe designated Operator shall, upon request and at least monthly, furnish to the other parties any and all information\\npertaining to wells drilled, production secured and hydrocarbons marketed from the Unit.  The books, records and\\nvouchers relating to the operation of the Unit shall be kept open to the non-operators for inspection at reasonable times.\\n8.   PAYMENT\\xa0FOR\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nDuring the period of recoupment, the revenue allocable to those owners of the integrated unleased mineral interest(s)\\nwho elect Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) and to the mineral interest(s) subject to and covered by the integrated uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) whose owners elect or shall be deemed to have elected Alternative No. B2 (Non-Consent), both described in Finding No. 8 above (collectively, the “non-consent interests”), shall be paid to those Consenting Parties that elect to acquire their proportionate share of such non-consent interests pursuant to Paragraph 9 of this Order.\\n9.   SHARING\\xa0OF\\xa0NON-CONSENT\\xa0INTERESTS\\nThe designated Operator shall offer each Consenting Party in the initial well who executes the JOA, or who elects to\\nparticipate under this Order, prior to the expiration of the Election Period an opportunity to acquire its proportionate share of all non-consent interests in the initial well pursuant to the terms of Article VI.B.2. of the JOA. The designated Operator shall likewise offer each Consenting Party in the initial well the opportunity to acquire its proportionate share of any leasehold interest acquired by the Applicant as the result of any unleased mineral owner’s deemed election under Alternative A4 of Finding No. 8 (collectively, the “A4 Interests”); provided, however, this Paragraph 9 shall not apply to:\\n(i) any A4 Interest that is not marketable; or\\n(ii) any A4 Interest that is less than a perpetual interest in the mineral estate (i.e. a term interest, life estate or remainder\\ninterest) and which must be integrated in order to make perpetual an existing leasehold interest in the Unit.\\nAny A4 Interest described in subpart (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be retained by the Applicant if the\\nApplicant is the owner of the existing leasehold interest which is made perpetual by such A4 Interest. If the Applicant is not the owner of such existing leasehold interest, the Applicant shall tender such A4 Interest to the owner(s) of the existing leasehold interest that is made perpetual by such A4 Interest.\\nAny Consenting Party electing to acquire a share of any A4 Interests, pursuant to this paragraph, shall notify the\\nApplicant within five business days after receiving an offer from the Applicant indicating the amount of interest available and the cost of that interest, and immediately reimburse the Applicant for such Consenting Party’s proportionate share of the lease bonus payable with respect to such A4 Interests.\\n10.

notice and public hearing in El Dorado, Arkansas, on December 02, 2014 the Arkansas Oil and Gas\\nCommission, in order to prevent waste, carry out an orderly program of development and protect the correlative rights of each owner in the common source(s) of supply in this drilling unit, has found the following facts and issued the following Order.\\nSTATEMENT\\xa0OF\\xa0THE\\xa0CASE\\nSEECO,  Inc.,  (the  “Applicant”),  filed  its  application  for  authority  to  drill  and  produce  its  proposed  Green  Bay\\nPackaging 11-8 1-27H34 well, pursuant to Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission General Rule B-43 (o), and to share the costs of such well and the natural gas produced therefrom between the working interest owners and royalty interest owners of the existing units consisting of Sections 27 and 34, Township 11 North, Range 8 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\\nFINDINGS\\xa0OF\\xa0FACT\\nFrom the evidence introduced at the hearing, the Commission finds:\\n1.   That the Applicant is operator and owns or has the support of the majority working interest within Sections 27\\nand 34, Township 11 North, Range 8 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\\n2.   The Applicant proposes to drill a cross-unit horizontal well targeting the Fayetteville Shale and any intervening\\nformations. The surface hole is planned in the NW/4 of Section 27, Township 11 North, Range 8 West down to a bottom hole location in the NW/4 of Section 34, Township 11 North, Range 8 West.\\n3.   Utilizing an area encompassed an exterior which is defined by a distance of 560 feet measured perpendicular\\nto both sides of the proposed well bore and a radius extending 560 feet from the first perforation (heel) and the last perforation (toe), the applicant estimates that the allocation area encompassing the perforated well bore is approximately 22.84% of Section 34, Township 11 North, Range 8 West, and 77.16% of Section 27, Township\\n11 North, Range 8 West.\\n4.   The  Applicant  proposes  that  operations  will  be  conducted  under  the  terms  of  Model  Form  Operating\\nAgreements adopted by the Commission, with the non-consent penalty being 400% for the proposed well; and that the above allocation of cost shall be effective for the drilling of the proposed well through the setting of production casing. The following terms will also govern the drilling and completion of the proposed well:\\n(A)         After the setting of production casing, but before a completion attempt is made, drilling cost will be\\nreallocated, based upon the actual perforated interval available for completion in the as-drilled well bore. This re-allocation may result in a revision to working interest and all costs paid to that point will be adjusted.\\n(B)         If a well bore is lost during the drilling or completion operation and a replacement well bore is\\nproposed with an alternate azimuth that will result in a further reallocation of working interest participation or the allocation of the production, the replacement well will be treated as a new well proposal with the revised interest. All parties that participate in the drilling and completion attempt in the initial well will be liable for their proportionate share of the actual cost of operation to the point of setting a plug for side-track operations, based on their original interest.\\n(C)         Should any party that elected to participate in the initial well elect to not participate in the replacement\\nwell, the penalty for a non-consent election in the replacement well will be imposed on only the replacement well costs.  A non-participating party in the initial well will not be afforded the opportunity\\nORDER NO. 347-2-2014\\nDecember 16, 2014\\nPage 2 of 3\\nto participate in the replacement well and their penalty will be imposed on the cumulative cost of the\\ninitial well and the replacement well.\\n(D)         Any re-allocation after the setting of production casing will be final for the completion attempt and for\\nthe ultimate allocation of production from the well between the respective units.\\n5.   That the granting of this application will be protective of the correlative rights of all interested parties and will\\nprevent waste of the natural gas by permitting an efficient method of developing the resource within multiple drilling units\\n6.   That no objections were filed.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\xa0OF\\xa0LAW\\n1.   That due notice of public hearing was given as required by law and that this Commission has jurisdiction over\\nsaid parties and the matter herein considered.\\n2.   That this Commission has authority to grant said application under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as\\namended.\\nORDER\\nIt is, therefore, Ordered by the Commission:\\n1.   The Applicant’s application for authority to produce its Green Bay Packaging 11-8 1-27H34 well is hereby\\napproved.\\n2.   The Applicant shall share the costs of such well and the natural gas produced therefrom in the manner\\ndescribed in Finding Nos. 3 and 4 above.\\n3.   That if the subject well encroaches upon but does not cross the drilling unit boundary of an adjoining drilling\\nunit (an “encroaching well”), the Commission shall not consider the encroached-upon drilling unit to be held by production from the encroaching well.\\n4.   That the following requirements are placed upon the drilling units from which production is allocated by\\napplicant’s well:\\na.

hearing in El Dorado, Arkansas, on July 23, 2013, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, in order to prevent waste, carry out an orderly program of development and protect the correlative rights of each owner in the common source(s) of supply in this drilling unit, has found the following facts and issued the following Order.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\n\\n\\n\\nSEECO, Inc., (the “Applicant”), filed its application for authority to drill and produce its proposed Higgs 10-11 9-15H9 well, pursuant to Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission General Rule B-43 (o), and to share the costs of such well and the natural gas produced therefrom between the working interest owners and royalty interest owners of the existing units consisting of Sections 9 and 10 Township 10 North, Range 11 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\\n\\n\\n\\nFINDINGS OF FACT\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the evidence introduced at the hearing, the Commission finds:\\n\\n\\n\\n1. That the Applicant is operator and owns or has the support of the majority working interest within Sections 9 and 10 Township 10 North, Range 11 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Applicant proposes to drill a cross-unit horizontal well targeting the Fayetteville Shale and any intervening formations. The surface hole is planned in the Northeast Quarter of Section 15, Township 10 North, Range 11 West with a bottom hole location in the Northwest Quarter of Section 9, Township 10 North, Range 11 West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tUtilizing an area encompassed an exterior which is defined by a distance of 560 feet measured perpendicular to both sides of the proposed well bore and a radius extending 560 feet from the first perforation (heel) and the last perforation (toe), the applicant estimates that the allocation area encompassing the perforated well bore is approximately 62.46% in Section 9 and 37.54% in Section 10, Township 10 North, Range 11 West.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Applicant proposes that operations will be conducted under the terms of Model Form Operating Agreements adopted by the Commission, with the non-consent penalty being 400% for the proposed well; and that the above allocation of cost shall be effective for the drilling of the proposed well through the setting of production casing. The following terms will also govern the drilling and completion of the proposed well:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tAfter the setting of production casing, but before a completion attempt is made, drilling cost will be reallocated, based upon the actual perforated interval available for completion in the as-drilled well bore. This re-allocation may result in a revision to working interest and all costs paid to that point will be adjusted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tIf a well bore is lost during the drilling or completion operation and a replacement well bore is proposed with an alternate azimuth that will result in a further reallocation of working interest participation or the allocation of the production, the replacement well will be treated as a new well proposal with the revised interest. All parties that participate in the drilling and completion attempt in the initial well will be liable for their proportionate share of the actual cost of operation to the point of setting a plug for side-track operations, based on their original interest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tShould any party that elected to participate in the initial well elect to not participate in the replacement well, the penalty for a non-consent election in the replacement well will be imposed on only the replacement well costs. A non-participating party in the initial well will not be afforded the opportunity to participate in the replacement well and their penalty will be imposed on the cumulative cost of the initial well and the replacement well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tAny re-allocation after the setting of production casing will be final for the completion attempt and for the ultimate allocation of production from the well between the respective units.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThat the granting of this application will be protective of the correlative rights of all interested parties and will prevent waste of the natural gas by permitting an efficient method of developing the resource within multiple drilling units\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThat written objections were filed by: Annette Capps; Peggy Capps; Charles Capps; Diamond Bluff Estates, LLC; Leonard & Patricia Uecker; Kathryn and Gary Seiler; Kenneth Mike Leird; Col.

That the Applicant is operator and owns or has the support of the majority working interest within Sections 22 \\n\\nand 23, Township 11 North, Range 10 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas. \\n\\n \\n2.  The Applicant proposes to drill a cross-unit horizontal well targeting the Fayetteville Shale and any intervening \\nformations. The surface hole is planned in the Southeast Quarter of Section 22, Township 11 North, Range 10 \\nWest with a bottom hole location in the Northwest Quarter of Section 23, Township 11 North, Range 10 West.   \\n\\n \\n3.  Utilizing an area encompassed an exterior which is defined by a distance of 560 feet measured perpendicular \\nto both sides of the proposed well bore and a radius extending 560 feet from the first perforation (heel) and the \\nlast perforation (toe), the applicant estimates that the allocation area encompassing the perforated well bore is \\napproximately 17.3% in Section 22 and 82.7% to Section 23, Township 11 North, Range 10 West. \\n\\n \\n4.  The  Applicant  proposes  that  operations  will  be  conducted  under  the  terms  of  Model  Form  Operating \\nAgreements adopted by the Commission, with the non-consent penalty being 400% for the proposed well; and \\nthat the above allocation of cost shall be effective for the drilling of the proposed well through the setting of \\nproduction casing. The following terms will also govern the drilling and completion of the proposed well: \\n\\n(A) \\n\\n \\n(B) \\n\\n(C) \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter the setting of production casing, but before a completion attempt is made, drilling cost will be \\nreallocated, based upon the actual perforated interval available for completion in the as-drilled well \\nbore.  This re-allocation may result in a revision to working interest and all costs paid to that point will \\nbe adjusted. \\n\\nIf  a  well  bore  is  lost  during  the  drilling  or  completion  operation  and  a  replacement  well  bore  is \\nproposed  with  an  alternate  azimuth  that  will  result  in  a  further  reallocation  of  working  interest \\nparticipation  or  the  allocation  of  the  production,  the  replacement  well  will  be  treated  as  a  new  well \\nproposal with the revised interest.  All parties that participate in the drilling and completion attempt in \\nthe initial well will be liable for their proportionate share of the actual cost of operation to the point of \\nsetting a plug for side-track operations, based on their original interest. \\n\\nShould any party that elected to participate in the initial well elect to not participate in the replacement \\nwell,  the  penalty  for  a  non-consent  election  in  the  replacement  well  will  be  imposed  on  only  the \\nreplacement well costs.  A non-participating party in the initial well will not be afforded the opportunity \\nto participate in the replacement well and their penalty will be imposed on the cumulative cost of the \\ninitial well and the replacement well. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cORDER NO. 171-2014-05 \\nJune 11, 2014 \\nPage 2 of 2 \\n \\n\\n(D) \\n\\n \\n\\nAny re-allocation after the setting of production casing will be final for the completion attempt and for \\nthe ultimate allocation of production from the well between the respective units.  \\n\\n5.  That the granting of this application will be protective of the correlative rights of all interested parties and will \\nprevent waste of the natural gas by permitting an efficient method of developing the resource within multiple \\ndrilling units \\n \\n\\n6.  That Applicant stated that it has at least 75% of the fee mineral ownership within each included drilling unit that \\ndoes not contain one or more wells satisfying the requirements of subpart 2)A.i) or subpart 2)A. iii) of General \\nRule B-43 o).  Evidence of this support was submitted prior to issuance of this order. \\n \\n\\n7.  That written comments were received from Kent Krug, Managing Member of Fayetteville Royalty, L.L.C.; and \\n\\n1.  That due notice of public hearing was given as required by law and that this Commission has jurisdiction over \\n\\nsaid parties and the matter herein considered. \\n\\n2.  That this Commission has authority to grant said application under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as \\n\\nKent Krug appeared at the hearing. \\n\\n \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \\n \\n\\namended. \\n\\n \\nORDER \\n \\nIt is, therefore, Ordered by the Commission: \\n \\n\\n1.

The  Applicant  shall  share  the  costs  of  such  well  and  the  natural  gas  produced  therefrom  in  the  manner \\n\\ndescribed in Finding Nos. 3 and 4 above. \\n\\n3.  That if the subject well encroaches upon but does not cross the drilling unit boundary of an adjoining drilling \\nunit (an “encroaching well”), the Commission shall not consider the encroached-upon drilling unit to be held by \\nproduction from the encroaching well. \\n \\n\\nThis Order shall be effective from and after June 11, 2014; and the Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction for \\nthe  purposes  of  enforcement,  and/or  modifications  or  amendments  to  the  provisions  of  this  Order.

This status \\ncould last for a three year period with full compliance. \\n\\n \\n2.

That the Applicant proposes the drilling and completion of its Hall C-9-14 #7-25H13 well within Sections 25 and\\n13, Township 9 North, Range 14 West, Van Buren County, Arkansas.\\n3.   That the projected perforated lateral of the Applicant’s Hall C-9-14 #7-25H13 well is expected to cross the\\nwellbore of the Eades 9-14 #1-24H well, located in Section 24, Township 9 North, Range 14 West, and thus the two wells will be closer than the allowed 560 feet at and near the point where their paths cross.\\n4.   General Rule B-43 provides that “cross-unit” wells are to be located no closer than 560 feet apart, unless\\nconsent is obtained from all owners within all applicable units within the time frame established, or an exception is granted by the Commission.

ALLOCATION\\xa0OF\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nThe hydrocarbons that are produced and saved from the well or wells assigned to the above described Unit shall\\nbe allocated to each separately owned tract embraced therein in the proportion that the acreage of such tract bears to the total acreage in the Unit and shall be considered as if produced from each such tract.\\n3.   OPERATOR\\xa0TO\\xa0CHARGE\\xa0COSTS\\nThe designated operator of the Unit shall have the right to charge to each participating party its proportionate share\\nof the actual expenditures required for the costs of developing and operating the well in the manner set forth in Exhibit “C” of the JOA.\\n4.   ELECTION\\xa0OF\\xa0ALTERNATIVES\\nThe owners of the unleased mineral and/or uncommitted leasehold working interests designated in Finding Nos. 5\\nand/or 6 above (unless dismissed at the request of the Applicant in the Statement of the Case above), in the aforementioned Unit shall have fifteen (15) days from the effective date of this order (the “Election Period”) to elect one of the alternatives as described in Finding No. 8 above. If no such election is made within the applicable Election Period, the owners of unleased mineral interest(s) shall be deemed to have elected under Alternative A4 and uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) owners shall be deemed to have elected under Alternative B3, as described in Finding No. 8. Any party choosing to participate or go non-consent or, who by the terms of this Order are deemed non-consent, shall be subject to the election period set forth in the JOA with respect to all subsequent wells drilled on the Unit.\\n5.   RECEIPT\\xa0OF\\xa0VALUE\\xa0OF\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nA.       Unleased\\xa0Mineral\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nIn the event the owners of the unleased mineral interest(s) elect Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) described\\nin Finding No. 8 above, then the value of the production proceeds attributable to such unleased mineral interest shall be subdivided and paid in accordance with the provisions of Order No. 6 as hereinafter set forth. The value of hydrocarbons produced shall be equal to the proceeds realized from the sale thereof at the well. Upon recoupment by the “Consenting Parties” (as defined in the JOA) of the total recoupment amount described in Finding No. 8A3 above, the production due the interest(s) of said parties shall be paid to them, their heirs, successors or assigns.\\nB.       Uncommitted\\xa0Leasehold\\xa0Working\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nIn the event an uncommitted leasehold working interest owner under one or more valid lease(s) elects\\nAlternative No. B2 (Non-Consent) described in Finding No. 8 above, the Consenting Parties shall have the right to receive the hydrocarbon production which would otherwise be delivered or paid to such uncommitted leasehold working interest owner under such lease(s) until such time as the proceeds realized from the sale of such production equals the total recoupment amount described in Finding No. 8B2 above.\\nThe leasehold royalty payable during the recoupment period shall be calculated on the basis of the rate or\\nrates provided in each of the leases creating the rights temporarily transferred pending recoupment.\\n6.   SUBDIVISION\\xa0OF\\xa0TRACT\\xa0ALLOCATION\\nThe revenue realized by the Consenting Parties from the sale of hydrocarbons shall be allocated among the\\nseparately owned tracts within the integrated unit and, pending recoupment of the costs and additional sum described at Paragraph No. 5 of this Order, shall be paid to the integrated parties as follows:\\nA.       Unleased\\xa0Mineral\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nUnleased mineral interest owners who have elected under Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) described in\\nFinding No. 8 above shall have the total allocation given to the tract subdivided into the working interest and royalty interest portions on the basis of seven-eighths (7/8th) of the total allocation being assigned to the working interest portion and one-eighth (1/8th) of the total allocation being assigned to the royalty interest\\nportion.\\nB.       Uncommitted\\xa0Leasehold\\xa0Working\\xa0Interest\\xa0Owner(s)\\nLeasehold royalty shall be paid according to the provisions of the valid lease(s) existing for each separately\\nowned tract, except where the Commission finds that such lease(s) provide for an excessive, unreasonably high, rate of royalty, as compared with the royalty determined by the Commission to be reasonable and consistent with the royalty negotiated for lease(s) made at arm\\'s length in the general area where the Unit is located, in which case the royalty stipulated in the second paragraph of Paragraph 5B of this Order shall be payable with respect to such lease(s).\\n7.   RECORDS\\xa0OF\\xa0UNIT\\xa0OPERATION\\nThe designated Operator shall, upon request and at least monthly, furnish to the other parties any and all\\ninformation pertaining to wells drilled, production secured and hydrocarbons marketed from the Unit. The books, records and vouchers relating to the operation of the Unit shall be kept open to the non-operators for inspection at reasonable times.\\n8.   PAYMENT\\xa0FOR\\xa0PRODUCTION\\nDuring the period of recoupment, the revenue allocable to those owners of the integrated unleased mineral\\ninterest(s) who elect Alternative No. A3 (Non-Consent) and to the mineral interest(s) subject to and covered by the integrated uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) whose owners elect or shall be deemed to have elected Alternative No. B2 (Non-Consent), both described in Finding No. 8 above (collectively, the “non-consent interests”), shall be paid to those Consenting Parties that elect to acquire their proportionate share of such non-consent interests pursuant to Paragraph 9 of this Order.\\n9.   SHARING\\xa0OF\\xa0NON-CONSENT\\xa0INTERESTS\\nThe designated Operator shall offer each Consenting Party in the initial well who executes the JOA, or who elects\\nto participate under this Order, prior to the expiration of the Election Period an opportunity to acquire its proportionate share of all non-consent interests in the initial well pursuant to the terms of Article VI.B.2. of the JOA. The designated Operator shall likewise offer each Consenting Party in the initial well the opportunity to acquire its proportionate share of any leasehold interest acquired by the Applicant as the result of any unleased mineral owner’s deemed election under Alternative A4 of Finding No. 8 (collectively, the “A4 Interests”); provided, however, this Paragraph 9 shall not apply to:\\n(i) any A4 Interest that is not marketable; or\\n(ii) any A4 Interest that is less than a perpetual interest in the mineral estate (i.e. a term interest, life estate or\\nremainder interest) and which must be integrated in order to make perpetual an existing leasehold interest in the Unit.\\nAny A4 Interest described in subpart (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be retained by the Applicant if\\nthe Applicant is the owner of the existing leasehold interest which is made perpetual by such A4 Interest. If the Applicant is not the owner of such existing leasehold interest, the Applicant shall tender such A4 Interest to the owner(s) of the existing leasehold interest that is made perpetual by such A4 Interest.\\nAny Consenting Party electing to acquire a share of any A4 Interests, pursuant to this paragraph, shall notify the\\nApplicant within five business days after receiving an offer from the Applicant indicating the amount of interest available and the cost of that interest, and immediately reimburse the Applicant for such Consenting Party’s proportionate share of the lease bonus payable with respect to such A4 Interests.\\n10.

Arkansas\\nAUTHORITY\\xa0TO\\xa0DRILL\\xa0AND\\xa0PRODUCE\\xa0WELL\\xa0/\\xa0SHARING\\xa0COSTS\\xa0AND\\xa0NATURAL\\xa0GAS\\xa0PRODUCED\\nAfter due notice and public hearing in El Dorado, Arkansas, on December 02, 2014 the Arkansas Oil and Gas\\nCommission, in order to prevent waste, carry out an orderly program of development and protect the correlative rights of each owner in the common source(s) of supply in this drilling unit, has found the following facts and issued the following Order.\\nSTATEMENT\\xa0OF\\xa0THE\\xa0CASE\\nSEECO, Inc., (the “Applicant”), filed its application for authority to drill and produce its proposed Shaver 9-6 #7-27H\\nwell, pursuant to Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission General Rule B-43 (o), and to share the costs of such well and the natural gas produced therefrom between the working interest owners and royalty interest owners of the existing units consisting of Section 27, Township 9 North, Range 6 West; and Section 22, Township 9 North, Range 6 West, White County, Arkansas.\\nFINDINGS\\xa0OF\\xa0FACT\\nFrom the evidence introduced at the hearing, the Commission finds:\\n1.   That the Applicant is operator and owns or has the support of the majority working interest within Section 27,\\nTownship 9 North, Range 6 West; Section 22, Township 9 North, Range 6 West, White County, Arkansas.\\n2.   The Applicant proposes to drill a cross-unit horizontal well targeting the Fayetteville Shale and any intervening\\nformations. The surface hole is planned in the SW/4 of Section 27, with a bottom hole location in the NW/4 of Section 27, Township 9 North, Range 6 West.\\n3.   Utilizing an area encompassed an exterior which is defined by a distance of 560 feet measured perpendicular\\nto both sides of the proposed well bore and a radius extending 560 feet from the first perforation (heel) and the last perforation (toe), the applicant estimates that the allocation area encompassing the perforated well bore is approximately 99.37% to Section 27, Township 9 North, Range 6 West and 0.63% to Section 22, Township 9 North, Range 6 West.\\n4.   The  Applicant  proposes  that  operations  will  be  conducted  under  the  terms  of  Model  Form  Operating\\nAgreements adopted by the Commission, with the non-consent penalty being 400% for the proposed well; and that the above allocation of cost shall be effective for the drilling of the proposed well through the setting of production casing. The following terms will also govern the drilling and completion of the proposed well:\\n(A)         After the setting of production casing, but before a completion attempt is made, drilling cost will be\\nreallocated, based upon the actual perforated interval available for completion in the as-drilled well bore. This re-allocation may result in a revision to working interest and all costs paid to that point will be adjusted.\\n(B)         If a well bore is lost during the drilling or completion operation and a replacement well bore is\\nproposed with an alternate azimuth that will result in a further reallocation of working interest participation or the allocation of the production, the replacement well will be treated as a new well proposal with the revised interest. All parties that participate in the drilling and completion attempt in the initial well will be liable for their proportionate share of the actual cost of operation to the point of setting a plug for side-track operations, based on their original interest.\\n(C)         Should any party that elected to participate in the initial well elect to not participate in the replacement\\nwell, the penalty for a non-consent election in the replacement well will be imposed on only the replacement well costs.  A non-participating party in the initial well will not be afforded the opportunity\\nORDER NO. 357-2014-12\\nDecember 16, 2014\\nPage 2 of 3\\nto participate in the replacement well and their penalty will be imposed on the cumulative cost of the\\ninitial well and the replacement well.\\n(D)         Any re-allocation after the setting of production casing will be final for the completion attempt and for\\nthe ultimate allocation of production from the well between the respective units.\\n5.   That the granting of this application will be protective of the correlative rights of all interested parties and will\\nprevent waste of the natural gas by permitting an efficient method of developing the resource within multiple drilling units\\n6.   That no objections were filed.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\xa0OF\\xa0LAW\\n1.   That due notice of public hearing was given as required by law and that this Commission has jurisdiction over\\nsaid parties and the matter herein considered.\\n2.   That this Commission has authority to grant said application under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as\\namended.\\nORDER\\nIt is, therefore, Ordered by the Commission:\\n1.

(the “Applicant”) filed its application for an Order pooling and integrating the unleased mineral interest(s) and/or \\nuncommitted leasehold working interest(s) of certain parties named therein who have failed to voluntarily integrate their \\ninterest(s) for the development of the unit comprising of Section 21, Township 8 North, Range 15 West, Conway County, \\nArkansas.  \\n  \\nThe Applicant presented proof that they had attempted unsuccessfully to acquire voluntary leases and/or other agreements \\nfor consideration or on terms equal to that otherwise offered and paid for similar leases or leasehold interest(s) in this drilling \\nunit.   \\n \\nAt the request of the Applicant, the following parties were dismissed by the Commission, regardless of whether the party or \\nparties are listed as unleased mineral interest(s) or uncommitted leasehold working interest(s) to be integrated:  \\n \\n \\n \\nFINDINGS OF FACT \\n \\nFrom the evidence introduced at said hearing, the Commission finds: \\n \\n 1.  That the Applicant has proposed to drill a well within a drilling unit (Unit) that the Commission has previously established, \\n\\nNONE \\n\\nconsisting of Section 21, Township 8 North, Range 15 West, Conway County, Arkansas.  \\n\\n2.  The Applicant plans to drill such well (the “initial well”) to test the Fayetteville Shale Formation and any intervening \\n\\nformations for the production of hydrocarbons. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3.  The requested Model Form Joint Operating Agreement employed by the Applicant and proposed to the owners set out in \\nFinding Nos. 5 and 6 (if any) below, is in the form of A.A.P.L. Form 610-1982 Model Form Operating Agreement (JOA),  \\namended, and modified as adopted by the Commission on October 28, 2008.  \\n\\n4.  The requested one-year term oil and gas lease (Lease) employed by the Applicant is in the form of Exhibit \"B\" of the \\n\\n \\n5.

The value \\nof hydrocarbons produced shall be equal to the proceeds realized from the sale thereof at the well.  Upon \\nrecoupment by the “Consenting Parties” (as defined in the JOA) of the total recoupment amount described in \\nFinding No. 8A3 above, the production due the interest(s) of said parties shall be paid to them, their heirs, \\nsuccessors or assigns. \\n\\n \\n\\nUncommitted Leasehold Working Interest Owner(s) \\n\\nIn the event an uncommitted leasehold working interest owner under one or more valid lease(s) elects Alternative \\nNo. B2 (Non-Consent) described in Finding No. 8 above, the Consenting Parties shall have the right to receive \\nthe hydrocarbon production which would otherwise be delivered or paid to such uncommitted leasehold working \\ninterest owner under such lease(s) until such time as the proceeds realized from the sale of such production \\nequals the total recoupment amount described in Finding No. 8B2 above.   \\n\\nThe leasehold royalty payable during the recoupment period shall be calculated on the basis of the rate or rates \\nprovided in each of the leases creating the rights temporarily transferred pending recoupment. \\n\\nB. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cORDER NO. 175-2014-06 \\nJuly 09, 2014 \\nPage 5 of 6 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n6.

SHARING OF NON-CONSENT INTERESTS \\n \\n\\nThe designated Operator shall offer each Consenting Party in the initial well who executes the JOA, or who elects to \\nparticipate under this Order, prior to the expiration of the Election Period an opportunity to acquire its proportionate \\nshare of all non-consent interests in the initial well pursuant to the terms of Article VI.B.2. of the JOA.  The designated \\nOperator shall likewise offer each Consenting Party in the initial well the opportunity to acquire its proportionate share of \\nany leasehold interest acquired by the Applicant as the result of any unleased mineral owner’s deemed election under \\nAlternative A4 of Finding No. 8 (collectively, the “A4 Interests”); provided, however, this Paragraph 9 shall not apply to: \\n \\n(i)  any A4 Interest that is not marketable; or  \\n \\n(ii) any A4 Interest that is less than a perpetual interest in the mineral estate (i.e. a term interest, life estate or remainder \\ninterest) and which must be integrated in order to make perpetual an existing leasehold interest in the Unit. \\n \\nAny A4 Interest described in subpart (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be retained by the Applicant if the \\nApplicant is the owner of the existing leasehold interest which is made perpetual by such A4 Interest.  If the Applicant is \\nnot the owner of such existing leasehold interest, the Applicant shall tender such A4 Interest to the owner(s) of the \\nexisting leasehold interest that is made perpetual by such A4 Interest. \\n \\nAny Consenting Party electing to acquire a share of any A4 Interests, pursuant to this paragraph, shall notify the \\nApplicant within five business days after receiving an offer from the Applicant indicating the amount of interest available \\n\\n\\x0cORDER NO. 175-2014-06 \\nJuly 09, 2014 \\nPage 6 of 6 \\n \\n\\n \\n10.

Although, gas contributes the lowering of use end emissions in power generation. The world energy demand and the increasing need of petrochemical products result in the exploitation of the oil and gas stocks. The estimations of the stocks and the forecasted usage have a significant deviation and uncertainty.\\n\\nCurrently, the growing of exploration and production is defined by economic and political demands, and environmental protection is the area of avoiding harmful impacts. \\n\\nThe legal requirement of the environmental impact assessment ensures that stakeholders can participate in the decision-making the process to protect their interest. \\n\\nThis study explores the environmental impacts of oil and gas exploration and production by technological steps, by process steps (exploration, implementation, production, demolition, recultivation), the risk, and opportunities to reduce the negative impacts and to mitigate the risks. ocr_input/AbstractThesisEnvironmentalEngineering.docx No ABSTRACT Environmental Oil Gas Exploration Production Oil gas exploration production significant environment Although gas lowering use end power generation world energy demand increasing need petrochemical result exploitation oil gas stock stock usage significant deviation uncertainty Currently growing exploration production defined economic political environmental protection area harmful legal requirement environmental impact assessment participate decision making process protect interest study environmental oil gas exploration production technological process exploration implementation production demolition recultivation risk reduce negative mitigate 46 141-2013-05.docx ocr_input ARKANSAS OIL AND GAS COMMISSION 301 NATURAL RESOURCES DRIVE SUITE 102\\n\\nLITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS 72205\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tORDER NO. 141-2013-05\\tJune 12, 2013\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Rule B-43 Well Spacing Area\\n\\nCleburne County, Arkansas\\n\\n\\n\\nEXCEPTION TO LOCATION PROVISIONS\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter due notice and public hearing in Fort Smith, Arkansas, on May 29, 2013, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, in order to prevent waste, carry out an orderly program of development and protect the correlative rights of each owner in the common source(s) of supply in this drilling unit, has found the following facts and issued the following Order.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\n\\n\\n\\nBHP Billiton Petroleum (Fayetteville) LLC.,(the “Applicant”), is requesting an exception to the location provisions of General Rule B-43 for a well encroaching closer than 560 feet to another well that extends across or encroaches upon drilling unit boundaries located in Sections 11 and 14, Township 9 North, Range 12 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\\n\\n\\n\\nFINDINGS OF FACT\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the evidence introduced at the hearing, the Commission finds:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThat BHP Billiton Petroleum (Fayetteville) LLC., (the “Applicant”), is requesting an exception to the location provisions of General Rule B-43 for a well encroaching closer than 560 feet to another well that extends across or encroaches upon drilling unit boundaries located in Sections 11 and 14, Township 9 North, Range 12 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThat the Applicant has drilled its Bennett Trust 9-12 3-11H14 well within Sections 11 and 14, Township 9 North, Range 12 West, Cleburne County, Arkansas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThat the projected perforated lateral of the Applicant’s Bennett Trust 9-12 3-11H14 well will be at one point 554 feet from the Bennett Trust 9-12 2-11H14 well and with spacing of 532 feet between the Bennett Trust 9-12 3- 11H14 well and the Bennett Trust 9-12 4-3H14.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tGeneral Rule B-43 provides that “cross-unit” wells are to be located no closer than 560 feet apart, unless consent is obtained from all owners within all applicable units within the time frame established, or an exception is granted by the Commission.

That the Applicant is operator and owns or has the support of the majority working interest within Sections 30 \\n\\nand 29, Township 11 North, Range 13 West, Van Buren County, Arkansas. \\n\\n \\n2.  The Applicant proposes to drill a cross-unit horizontal well targeting the Fayetteville Shale and any intervening \\nformations. The surface hole is planned in the Northeast Quarter of Section 30, Township 11 North, Range 13 \\nWest with a bottom hole location in the Southwest Quarter of Section 29, Township 11 North, Range 13 West.   \\n\\n \\n3.  Utilizing an area encompassed an exterior which is defined by a distance of 560 feet measured perpendicular \\nto both sides of the proposed well bore and a radius extending 560 feet from the first perforation (heel) and the \\nlast perforation (toe), the applicant estimates that the allocation area encompassing the perforated well bore is \\napproximately 43.65% in Section 30 and 56.35% to Section 29, Township 11 North, Range 13 West. \\n\\n \\n4.  The  Applicant  proposes  that  operations  will  be  conducted  under  the  terms  of  Model  Form  Operating \\nAgreements adopted by the Commission, with the non-consent penalty being 400% for the proposed well; and \\nthat the above allocation of cost shall be effective for the drilling of the proposed well through the setting of \\nproduction casing. The following terms will also govern the drilling and completion of the proposed well: \\n\\n(A) \\n\\n \\n(B) \\n\\n(C) \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter the setting of production casing, but before a completion attempt is made, drilling cost will be \\nreallocated, based upon the actual perforated interval available for completion in the as-drilled well \\nbore.  This re-allocation may result in a revision to working interest and all costs paid to that point will \\nbe adjusted. \\n\\nIf  a  well  bore  is  lost  during  the  drilling  or  completion  operation  and  a  replacement  well  bore  is \\nproposed  with  an  alternate  azimuth  that  will  result  in  a  further  reallocation  of  working  interest \\nparticipation  or  the  allocation  of  the  production,  the  replacement  well  will  be  treated  as  a  new  well \\nproposal with the revised interest.  All parties that participate in the drilling and completion attempt in \\nthe initial well will be liable for their proportionate share of the actual cost of operation to the point of \\nsetting a plug for side-track operations, based on their original interest. \\n\\nShould any party that elected to participate in the initial well elect to not participate in the replacement \\nwell,  the  penalty  for  a  non-consent  election  in  the  replacement  well  will  be  imposed  on  only  the \\nreplacement well costs.  A non-participating party in the initial well will not be afforded the opportunity \\nto participate in the replacement well and their penalty will be imposed on the cumulative cost of the \\ninitial well and the replacement well. \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cAny re-allocation after the setting of production casing will be final for the completion attempt and for \\nthe ultimate allocation of production from the well between the respective units.  \\n\\n5.  That the granting of this application will be protective of the correlative rights of all interested parties and will \\nprevent waste of the natural gas by permitting an efficient method of developing the resource within multiple \\ndrilling units \\n \\n\\n1.  That due notice of public hearing was given as required by law and that this Commission has jurisdiction over \\n\\nsaid parties and the matter herein considered. \\n\\n2.  That this Commission has authority to grant said application under the provisions of Act No. 105 of 1939, as \\n\\nORDER NO. 154-2014-05 \\nJune 03, 2014 \\nPage 2 of 3 \\n \\n\\n(D) \\n\\n \\n\\n6.  That no objections were filed. \\n \\n\\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \\n \\n\\namended. \\n\\n \\nORDER \\n \\nIt is, therefore, Ordered by the Commission: \\n \\n\\n1.  The Applicant’s application for authority to produce its Smith #5-30H29 well is hereby approved. \\n \\n2.  The  Applicant  shall  share  the  costs  of  such  well  and  the  natural  gas  produced  therefrom  in  the  manner \\n\\ndescribed in Finding Nos. 3 and 4 above. \\n\\n3.  That if the subject well encroaches upon but does not cross the drilling unit boundary of an adjoining drilling \\nunit (an “encroaching well”), the Commission shall not consider the encroached-upon drilling unit to be held by \\nproduction from the encroaching well. \\n\\n4.  That  the  following  requirements  are  placed  upon  the  drilling  units  from  which  production  is  allocated  by \\n\\napplicant’s well: \\n\\n \\na. \\n\\nThere is at least one well located, as defined in subsection (a)(2) of General Rule B-3, at a non-\\nexceptional well location and located entirely within each included drilling unit that is producing or \\ncapable of producing gas; or \\n\\n \\nb.
