Authority to collect information is in section 205(a), 1862, 1872 and 1874 of the Social Security Act as amended, 42 CFR 411.24(a) and 424.5(a) (6), and44 USC 3101;41 CFR 101 et seq and 10 USC 1079 and 1086; 5 USC 8101 et seq; and 30 USC 901 et seq; 38 USC 613; E.O. 9397.The information we obtain to complete claims under these programs is used to identify you and to determine your eligibility. It is also used to decide if the servicesand supplies you received are covered by these programs and to insure that proper payment is made.The information may also be given to other providers of services, carriers, intermediaries, medical review boards, health plans, and other organizations or Federalagencies, for the effective administration of Federal provisions that require other third parties payers to pay primary to Federal program, and as otherwise necessaryto administer these programs. For example, it may be necessary to disclose information about the benefits you have used to a hospital or doctor.

With the one exception discussedbelow, there are no penalties under these programs for refusing to supply information. However, failure to furnish information regarding the medical services renderedor the amount charged would prevent payment of claims under these programs. Failure to furnish any other information, such as name or claim number, would delaypayment of the claim.
